JavaScript: Password Generator

<!-- About -->
For this assignment I was required to modify starter code to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It will have a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.

Simply click the button to generate a password
and you will be presented with a series of prompts for password criteria.
These prompts include character length (between 8-128 characters), lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
Once your inputs are validated and at least one character type is selected, then a password is generated that matches the selected criteria.
The generated password is then displayed in the box.

Enjoy!
